# Sol-
You're running into this error because **PowerShell doesn't handle spaces in file paths well unless you quote the entire path**.

Your path contains a space:

```
Tazuddin Ahmed
```

So PowerShell thinks you're giving it multiple arguments, which it can't process.

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Way to `cd` into That Path in PowerShell

Wrap the **entire path** in **double quotes** like this:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Tazuddin Ahmed\.cache\kagglehub\datasets\dylanjcastillo\7k-books-with-metadata\versions\3"
```

or use `Set-Location` (which is what `cd` maps to in PowerShell):

```powershell
Set-Location "C:\Users\Tazuddin Ahmed\.cache\kagglehub\datasets\dylanjcastillo\7k-books-with-metadata\versions\3"
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistake: Missing Quotes with Spaces

This:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Tazuddin Ahmed\...
```

fails because `Tazuddin` and `Ahmed\...` are treated as **two separate parameters**.

---

## ‚úÖ Tip: Drag and Drop the Folder

In PowerShell or VS Code terminal, you can **drag the folder** from File Explorer directly into the terminal ‚Äî it will automatically insert the properly quoted full path.

---

Let me know if you now want to load a CSV or JSON file from that folder using `pandas` or need to inspect the dataset!

## üßæ Issue Report: `gaierror: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed` While Downloading Dataset Using `kagglehub`

### ‚ùó Problem Summary

While attempting to download a Kaggle dataset using the `kagglehub` library, the following error occurred:

```python
gaierror: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed

ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.kaggle.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/v1/datasets/view/dylanjcastillo/7k-books-with-metadata
(Caused by NameResolutionError: Failed to resolve 'www.kaggle.com')
```

### üß† Root Cause

This error is caused by the system's inability to resolve the domain name `www.kaggle.com` to an IP address. In technical terms, this is a **DNS resolution failure**, which may happen due to:

* Misconfigured or outdated DNS cache.
* Faulty or restricted DNS servers (e.g., from ISP or corporate network).
* VPN, proxy, or firewall interfering with DNS traffic.
* Lack of internet connectivity.

DNS resolution failed even with a basic Python socket test:

```python
import socket
socket.gethostbyname("www.kaggle.com")
# Resulted in gaierror: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Resolution Steps

1. **Flushed DNS Cache (Windows):**
   Opened Command Prompt as Administrator and ran:

   ```bash
   ipconfig /flushdns
   ```

After running this run the socket cell again.

4. **Re-ran the `kagglehub` Script:**

   ```python
   import kagglehub

   path = kagglehub.dataset_download("dylanjcastillo/7k-books-with-metadata")
   print("Path to dataset files:", path)
   ```

   ‚úÖ Successfully connected and downloaded dataset.

---

### ‚úÖ Outcome

After updating the DNS settings and flushing the DNS cache, the system was able to resolve Kaggle‚Äôs domain name correctly. The dataset was successfully downloaded without further issues.

---

### üìå Recommendations

* Always verify internet and DNS connectivity when encountering network-related errors.
* For reliability, prefer public DNS servers such as Google (`8.8.8.8`) or Cloudflare (`1.1.1.1`).
* Document any environment-specific settings (VPNs, proxies) that might affect network access for reproducibility.

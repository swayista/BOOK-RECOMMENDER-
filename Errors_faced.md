# Sol-
You're running into this error because **PowerShell doesn't handle spaces in file paths well unless you quote the entire path**.

Your path contains a space:

```
Tazuddin Ahmed
```

So PowerShell thinks you're giving it multiple arguments, which it can't process.

---

## ✅ Correct Way to `cd` into That Path in PowerShell

Wrap the **entire path** in **double quotes** like this:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Tazuddin Ahmed\.cache\kagglehub\datasets\dylanjcastillo\7k-books-with-metadata\versions\3"
```

or use `Set-Location` (which is what `cd` maps to in PowerShell):

```powershell
Set-Location "C:\Users\Tazuddin Ahmed\.cache\kagglehub\datasets\dylanjcastillo\7k-books-with-metadata\versions\3"
```

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistake: Missing Quotes with Spaces

This:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Tazuddin Ahmed\...
```

fails because `Tazuddin` and `Ahmed\...` are treated as **two separate parameters**.

---

## ✅ Tip: Drag and Drop the Folder

In PowerShell or VS Code terminal, you can **drag the folder** from File Explorer directly into the terminal — it will automatically insert the properly quoted full path.

---

Let me know if you now want to load a CSV or JSON file from that folder using `pandas` or need to inspect the dataset!
